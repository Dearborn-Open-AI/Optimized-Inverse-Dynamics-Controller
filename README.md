# Optimized-PID-Controller
PID Controller coefficients obtained for a Mass-Spring System with disturbance, by Genetic and gradient descent algorithms.
___
## how ot run
1.Change parameters of your dynamical system in 'simulation_fcn.m' function.
2.Change parameters of nonlinear constraint in 'input_constraint.m' function.
3.run 'main.m' file and get best coefficents of PID controller.
