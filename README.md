# Optimized-PID-Controller
PID Controller coefficients obtained for a Mass-Spring System with disturbance, by metaheuristic (genetic) and classic (gradient descent) algorithms.

## how ot run
1.Change parameters of your dynamical system in simulation_fcn.m and input_constraint.m files.

2.Change parameters of main.m file if you want and then run the code in Matlab.
